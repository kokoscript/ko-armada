Toy program for PC-9821 series computers. Exercise in learning the PEGC hardware.

## Building

You can find a pre-made DJGPP dev environment [here](https://www.target-earth.net/wiki/doku.php?id=blog:pc98_devtools). Once that's set up...

```
make
```

That's it. You'll need to change the first line of the Makefile if DJGPP isn't installed to `A:¥PROGS¥DJGPP`.

## Performance

Sucks
